The AI module in this project is the core intelligence of the Autism Spectrum Disorder Smart Care System.
It consists of:

🧩 Autism Diagnosis Model: Predicts the likelihood of autism based on user responses and behavioral indicators.

🎚️ Severity Detection Model: Determines the degree of autism (Mild, Moderate, Severe) using a specialized ML classifier.

💬 Specialized Chatbot: Acts as a virtual ASD expert that provides autism-related insights, screening assistance, and care recommendations in Arabic and English.

🔊 Voice Interaction Support: Allows users to interact via speech for more natural and inclusive communication.

Together, these AI components form an intelligent ecosystem that supports early detection, continuous assessment, and personalized guidance for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
